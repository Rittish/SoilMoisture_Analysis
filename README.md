# SoilMoisture_Analysis
🌱 IoT Soil Moisture Monitoring System using ESP8266 & Firebase
This project is a smart Embedded + IoT system designed to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and a Soil Moisture Sensor. The sensed data is sent to Firebase Realtime Database, where it is accessed and visualized via a custom-built frontend dashboard.

🔧 Technologies Used

1. ESP8266 (NodeMCU) – Microcontroller for sensor data collection and Wi-Fi communication
2. Soil Moisture Sensor – Captures the moisture content from the soil
3. Firebase Realtime Database – Stores the sensor data in real-time
4. Frontend Web Dashboard – Visualizes the data and supports download in Excel and JSON formats
5. HTML/CSS/JavaScript – For frontend development
6. Firebase SDK – For real-time data syncing

🛠️ Features

📡 Real-time soil moisture monitoring
🔥 Seamless integration with Firebase Realtime Database
🌐 Web-based monitoring dashboard
📥 Export sensor data as Excel (.xlsx) or JSON (.json)
📊 Simple and clean UI for easy data visualization
